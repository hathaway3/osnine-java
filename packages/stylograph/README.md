# Stylograph

This directory contains two versions of Stylograph. v. 2.1 for Dragon 64 and 3.0 for TRS-80 Color Computer.

Version 2.1 contains definitions for about 30 terminal types, but these
were overwritten by a binary patch containing the GO51 sequences and
shortened help texts. It was possible to reconstruct the original code.

Version 3.0 contains definition for three terminal types, which were
common on the Coco. The main difference from 2.1 seems to be the ability
to have different terminal types for different serial devices.
