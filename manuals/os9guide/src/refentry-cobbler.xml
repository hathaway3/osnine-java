<refsect1><title>Description</title>
<para>
<command>Cobbler</command> is used to create the <filename>OS9Boot</filename> file required on any disk
from which OS-9 is to be bootstrapped. The boot file will consist
of the <emphasis>same modules which were loaded into memory during the most recent bootstrap.</emphasis>
To add modules to the bootstrap file use the
<command>OS9Gen</command> command.

If the system is not booting from ROM, then <command>cobbler</command> also writes the OS-9 kernel on the boot track<footnote>
    <para>On the TRS-80 Color Computer, this is the first fifteen sectors of track 34. On Dragon 64, it is sectors 2-15 on track 0.</para>
</footnote>, and excludes these sectors from the disk allocation map. If any files are present on these sectors
<command>cobbler</command> will display an error message.

Level Two systems <emphasis>must</emphasis> use <command>OS9Gen</command> to create bootstrap files.

<para>
NOTE: The boot file must fit into one contiguous block on the mass-storage
device. For this reason <command>cobbler</command> is normally used on a
freshly formatted disk. If <command>cobbler</command> is used on a disk and there is
not a contiguous block of storage large enough to hold the boot
file, the old boot file may have been destroyed and OS-9 will not be
able to boot from that disk until it is reformatted.
